# Assignment: Build a Basic Recipe Website

### Objective:
For this project youâ€™ll be creating an entire web page from a design weâ€™ll provide for you. If youâ€™ve been following along you should have the skills you need to accomplish this, but it may not be easy!

The design weâ€™re providing you comes in the form of 2 images: one is an image of the complete website, and one has some details about some of the fonts and colors weâ€™ve used.

### Task:
Build a basic recipe website with the following specifications:

- Get your project as close as you can to the design, but do not worry about getting it pixel-perfect.

- Don't peek at other students finished assignments. Try to use google and TOP Discord for help.

- Do not worry about making your project look nice on a mobile device. Weâ€™ll learn that later.
